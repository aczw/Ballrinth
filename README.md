# Ballrinth user guide

The controls of the game are simple. Use the arrow keys to tilt the labyrinth in order to guide the rolling ball to the exit (the golden square). The whole game is physics-based, so the ball will roll downhill, so tilt the maze in the direction that you want the ball to go!

When you beat a maze, you will be presented with an intermission screen that allows you to select one power-up from three choices. You can also choose to skip and click the continue button to enter the next stage.

Each progressive maze grows in size, and you have limited time. You have three inventory slots to store the power-ups, which can be activated with Z, X, and C respectively. They modify the time and help you get further, so use them often.

Depending on how many mazes you escaped, when you run out of time you will either win (beat the high score) or lose (escape less mazes than the high score).
